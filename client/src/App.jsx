        Props as References and Closures in JavaScript
        why in above gameboard line we just passed selectsquarechangesplayer function but inside it is using setgameturns and we are not passing it explicitely. then also in gameboard component this function works fine. It does not work if we import this function in gameboard component explicitely and then use it because:

1. Passing Functions as Props:

In React, when a function is passed as a prop, the function is passed by reference.

The function retains its original closure (lexical environment), allowing it to access variables defined in its scope at the time of its declaration.

This is why the function works correctly when called from the child componentâ€”it has access to state variables (e.g., setGameTurns) from its parent component.


2. Importing a Function:

When a function is exported and imported into another module, it loses access to its closure because it no longer resides in the same lexical scope where it was defined.

Dependencies like setGameTurns are not automatically imported with the function and must be explicitly passed or redefined in the new module.

This is intentional to maintain modularity and isolate scopes between files.


3. Why Closures Work with Props:

Closures in JavaScript preserve access to the scope in which a function was declared.

When a function is passed as a prop, the parent component provides it with the closure needed to reference variables like setGameTurns.


4.Why Closures Don't Automatically Work Across Modules:

Modules in JavaScript are designed to be isolated units with their own scope.

Exporting a function only exports the function logic, not its surrounding closure.

To use such a function in another module, dependencies (e.g., state setters like setGameTurns) must be explicitly passed.
